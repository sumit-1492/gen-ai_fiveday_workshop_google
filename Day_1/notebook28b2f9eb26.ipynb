    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

From its origins in the Mediterranean basin, the olive has become a cornerstone of cultures, cuisines, and even economies worldwide. Its significance extends far beyond its role as a tasty snack or ingredient. The olive, in its diverse forms, plays a vital role in shaping modern society, impacting our health, environment, and even our understanding of history.\n",

      "Firstly, the olive's nutritional value is undeniable. Its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, has been linked to numerous health benefits. Studies have shown that regular consumption of olive oil can lower cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart disease, and even protect against certain types of cancer. This has led to a growing demand for olive oil, making it a sought-after commodity globally. As consumer awareness of healthy eating grows, the olive's position as a nutritional\n"

It beckoned him, promising a world beyond the manicured lawn and the watchful eye of Mrs. Henderson, the grumpy old neighbor. With a determined flick of his tail, he squeezed through the gap and found himself in a world of tall, waving grass and fragrant wildflowers.\n",

Bartholomew, emboldened by the vibrant world around him, started exploring. He stalked a plump earthworm, its wriggling form a delicious temptation. He climbed a towering oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky, offering him a view of the world from a new perspective.\n",

He had never ventured so far, and the unfamiliar world seemed to stretch out endlessly before him. Suddenly, a rustle in the bushes caught his attention. A pair of bright eyes glinted in the fading light. A large, furry creature, a dog with a wagging tail and a friendly bark, approached him.\n",

They spent the rest of the evening playing tag in the field, their laughter echoing through the twilight. As the moon rose high in the sky, the dog, whose name, Bartholomew learned, was Bruno, led him back to the fence.\n",

As he curled up on his favorite cushion, he knew that his life would never be the same. The world beyond the fence was a place of wonder and excitement, a place he would always remember, a place he would always long to explore again.\n",

       "**Why Use it?**\n",

       "* **Increased Productivity:** By having the Git repository status readily available in your prompt, you can quickly see the current state and make informed decisions.\n",
       "* **Improved Context:** The script provides valuable context about your project, reducing the need to run separate `git` commands.\n",
       "* **Enhanced Development Experience:**  It makes it easier to navigate your codebase and track changes.\n",
